      <description>Paperchain isn&amp;rsquo;t the product or company it was 12 months ago.
We published an update earlier in the year on the direction the company was taking.
From our initial focus on metadata and royalty payments, we saw a larger need across all media verticals to address systemic problems related to payment expediency and cost of capital.
Over the past two years, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies moved to the forefront of technology and finance media.</description>

      <description>Here’s How You Know Mic-Coalition “Shiv Act” Is About Screwing Songwriters Not Transparency But here is where the bill is particular cruel. If a songwriter does not report information on a single cover, the way the bill is written, the songwriter then loses their rights for EVERY recording. I don’t think this is an accident. This actually creates a mechanism for depriving every songwriter of legal fees and statutory damages, on every song ever written.</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a streaming service or performing rights organisation is unable to identify the rights owner to pay royalties to, unpaid royalties are held in “royalty black boxes”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global value of these royalty black boxes is estimated to be $2.5bn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paperchain has developed a product to connect rights owners to their unpaid royalties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australian founder Daniel Dewar is basing Paperchain out of London to focus on the large publishing and recording industry opportunities in the US, UK and Europe&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than 46 million instances of unidentified songwriters or unknown copyright owner Notice of Intents (NOIs) digitally filed with the US Copyright Office by streaming services since April 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are filed under the Notice of Intention to Obtain a Compulsory License - Section 115 clause in the US Copyright Act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royalties are unpaid and go into “royalty black boxes” until the owner is identified or dispersed into the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global value of these royalty black boxes is estimated to be $2.5bn&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most feverous conversations happening around digital music is the ability for artists to maintain ownership and attribution for their work. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that blockchain technology—in particular Ethereum, with its use of smart contracts—has driven a surge in music technology startups attempting to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday we&amp;rsquo;re reading about startups coming up with wonderfully creative applications of the technology in order to solve a similar pain point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
