      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Protocol Canvas is a means of mapping primitives between actors within a decentralized protocol. Derived from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Business Model Canvas&lt;/a&gt;, the Protocol Canvas is designed for decentralized systems and is a fully &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Paperchain/protocol-canvas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt; effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of creating the Protocol Canvas is to help individuals and organizations capture their protocol design in a standardized way and to contribute towards the newly-realized discipline of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tokenegineering.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Token Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This meetup has been in the pipeline for a while and I’m glad to finally announce the kick-off for the NYC edition of the Token Engineering community meetup. We at Paperchain are very interested in exploring token models that can shift paradigms of data, commerce and services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Data Analysis of the Apparent ‘Fake Artists’ of Spotify</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the publication Music Business Worldwide(MBW) published a story about Spotify denying that they are play-listing fake artists. There was some harsh criticism and claims that Spotify was creating its own recordings and putting them on their playlists. What struck me the most about this story was that the statement about there being a large amount of music on Spotify that was created by fake artists and that the “artist name” under which these tracks are listed cannot actually be identified. A list of 50 artists were published on MBW.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
