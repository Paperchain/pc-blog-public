      <description>Paperchain isn&amp;rsquo;t the product or company it was 12 months ago.
We published an update earlier in the year on the direction the company was taking.
From our initial focus on metadata and royalty payments, we saw a larger need across all media verticals to address systemic problems related to payment expediency and cost of capital.
Over the past two years, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies moved to the forefront of technology and finance media.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about something Tony Sheng wrote recently on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tonysheng.com/red-ocean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;smart contract protocols and red ocean&lt;/a&gt; theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the drive in speculative markets around cryptocurrencies, we saw an ever growing list of projects become funded, make promises, and for the large part continue to remain in incubation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing the Protocol Canvas — Designing Better Decentralized Protocols</title>
      <link>/post/2018-08-24-introducing-protocol-canvas-designing-better-decentralized-protocols/</link>

      <guid>/post/2018-08-24-introducing-protocol-canvas-designing-better-decentralized-protocols/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Protocol Canvas is a means of mapping primitives between actors within a decentralized protocol. Derived from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Business Model Canvas&lt;/a&gt;, the Protocol Canvas is designed for decentralized systems and is a fully &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Paperchain/protocol-canvas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt; effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of creating the Protocol Canvas is to help individuals and organizations capture their protocol design in a standardized way and to contribute towards the newly-realized discipline of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tokenegineering.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Token Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Here’s How You Know Mic-Coalition “Shiv Act” Is About Screwing Songwriters Not Transparency But here is where the bill is particular cruel. If a songwriter does not report information on a single cover, the way the bill is written, the songwriter then loses their rights for EVERY recording. I don’t think this is an accident. This actually creates a mechanism for depriving every songwriter of legal fees and statutory damages, on every song ever written.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of discussion in the music industry right now around transparency and rights management. This is in tandem with a discussion on how this would be implemented, and at the moment that discussion is being led by blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is a relatively new technology, there’s not many who understand the technology and why it would be suggested as a solution for many of the music industry’s rights data challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a streaming service or performing rights organisation is unable to identify the rights owner to pay royalties to, unpaid royalties are held in “royalty black boxes”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global value of these royalty black boxes is estimated to be $2.5bn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paperchain has developed a product to connect rights owners to their unpaid royalties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australian founder Daniel Dewar is basing Paperchain out of London to focus on the large publishing and recording industry opportunities in the US, UK and Europe&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;More than 46 million instances of unidentified songwriters or unknown copyright owner Notice of Intents (NOIs) digitally filed with the US Copyright Office by streaming services since April 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are filed under the Notice of Intention to Obtain a Compulsory License - Section 115 clause in the US Copyright Act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royalties are unpaid and go into “royalty black boxes” until the owner is identified or dispersed into the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global value of these royalty black boxes is estimated to be $2.5bn&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Data Analysis of the Apparent ‘Fake Artists’ of Spotify</title>

      <guid>/post/data-analysis-of-the-apparent-fake-artists-of-spotify/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the publication Music Business Worldwide(MBW) published a story about Spotify denying that they are play-listing fake artists. There was some harsh criticism and claims that Spotify was creating its own recordings and putting them on their playlists. What struck me the most about this story was that the statement about there being a large amount of music on Spotify that was created by fake artists and that the “artist name” under which these tracks are listed cannot actually be identified. A list of 50 artists were published on MBW.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Crammed in at the last minute before the state House went into recess, the measures were part of a broader series of amendments that legally recognized any number of records being stored on a blockchain.

      <description>Streaming generates vast amounts of royalty data, and not all collecting societies are coping The growth of streaming has meant a vast increase in the amount of data being supplied to collecting societies in order to calculate the royalty payments due to songwriters and music publishers. Some are processing this data better than others, but issues with conflicting information in some society databases only makes things more difficult. Read more</description>

The latest music report featured enough positive growth indicators to put the music industry in a good mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global recorded music revenues grew by 5.9% in 2016, with revenues totalling US$15.7 billion. This growth was largely driven by streaming, with Digital income now accounting for 50% of global music revenues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal Paying $1.6 Million a DAY In Major Label Guarantees
On-demand streaming services Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer, Rhapsody, and others collectively paid nearly $1.6 million in guaranteed payments a day to just three major recording labels last quarter. Total ‘minimum guarantees’ topped $144 million over the 91 day period, a figure that likely doesn’t include preferred advertising inventory and other juicy perks. That is on top of royalties for actual plays, which more than quintupled that figure.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As awareness moves beyond BitCoin and cryptocurrencies to distributed ledgers, blockchain is fast-becoming the dominant (theoretical) solution to challenges facing many industries. No more so than the music industry—an industry plagued with inefficient and outdated data practices that interferes with the creation and maintenance of reliable data records, resulting in unpaid royalty revenue to artists, publishers and labels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
