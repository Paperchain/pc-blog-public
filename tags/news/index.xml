      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Mar 21 I created a new page in our company wiki called &amp;ldquo;How we work remote&amp;rdquo;. This was the opening note I shared with my team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had already began limited office hours in New York, and at the time New York was discussing a wider lockdown. While we had been a distributed team, with people in New York, Berlin, and India, now we were fully distributed even within New York. The Paperchain team works from Manhattan, Staten Island, Long Island, Poconos, Berlin and Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is a work in progress as we refine our remote work practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Australian founder Daniel Dewar to tackle $2.5bn in music royalty black boxes with music technology startup Paperchain</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a streaming service or performing rights organisation is unable to identify the rights owner to pay royalties to, unpaid royalties are held in “royalty black boxes”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global value of these royalty black boxes is estimated to be $2.5bn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paperchain has developed a product to connect rights owners to their unpaid royalties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australian founder Daniel Dewar is basing Paperchain out of London to focus on the large publishing and recording industry opportunities in the US, UK and Europe&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>London-based startup Paperchain to tackle $2.5bn in music royalty black boxes from 46m NOI filings to US Copyright Office</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than 46 million instances of unidentified songwriters or unknown copyright owner Notice of Intents (NOIs) digitally filed with the US Copyright Office by streaming services since April 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are filed under the Notice of Intention to Obtain a Compulsory License - Section 115 clause in the US Copyright Act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royalties are unpaid and go into “royalty black boxes” until the owner is identified or dispersed into the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global value of these royalty black boxes is estimated to be $2.5bn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paperchain has developed a product to connect rights owners to their unpaid royalties&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most feverous conversations happening around digital music is the ability for artists to maintain ownership and attribution for their work. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that blockchain technology—in particular Ethereum, with its use of smart contracts—has driven a surge in music technology startups attempting to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday we&amp;rsquo;re reading about startups coming up with wonderfully creative applications of the technology in order to solve a similar pain point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
