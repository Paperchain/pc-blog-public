&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At DeFi Summit London, Paperchain worked with Centrifuge and the Maker Foundation (“Maker”) to advance $60,000 USD in Spotify revenue to a Paperchain record label customer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While media consumption has shifted to streaming and on demand models, the revenue and payments process hasn’t changed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue from a Spotify stream can take 3 months to reach a record label; 6 months to reach an artist. $100 billion USD sits trapped in 90 day accounts receivables across the wider digital media industry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The advance was issued live on stage using Centrifuge’s Tinlake finance application, and was originated in less than 30 minutes at a transaction cost of less than $3 USD;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has the potential to disrupt traditional financing and secured lending products through programmatic, data-driven asset creation, and low origination costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
