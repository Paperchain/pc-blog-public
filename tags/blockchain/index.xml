      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 1st 2019, we wrapped up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techstars.com/programs/alchemist-blockchain-program/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Techstars Alchemist Blockchain Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; program, pitching to 200+ investors at the Metrograph Theater in New York City&amp;rsquo;s Lower East Side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countless hours went into preparing for this event and it was the culmination of a lot of hard work from all of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about something Tony Sheng wrote recently on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tonysheng.com/red-ocean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;smart contract protocols and red ocean&lt;/a&gt; theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the drive in speculative markets around cryptocurrencies, we saw an ever growing list of projects become funded, make promises, and for the large part continue to remain in incubation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing the Protocol Canvas — Designing Better Decentralized Protocols</title>
      <link>/post/2018-08-24-introducing-protocol-canvas-designing-better-decentralized-protocols/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Protocol Canvas is a means of mapping primitives between actors within a decentralized protocol. Derived from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Business Model Canvas&lt;/a&gt;, the Protocol Canvas is designed for decentralized systems and is a fully &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Paperchain/protocol-canvas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt; effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of creating the Protocol Canvas is to help individuals and organizations capture their protocol design in a standardized way and to contribute towards the newly-realized discipline of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tokenegineering.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Token Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Here’s How You Know Mic-Coalition “Shiv Act” Is About Screwing Songwriters Not Transparency But here is where the bill is particular cruel. If a songwriter does not report information on a single cover, the way the bill is written, the songwriter then loses their rights for EVERY recording. I don’t think this is an accident. This actually creates a mechanism for depriving every songwriter of legal fees and statutory damages, on every song ever written.</description>

      <title>The Music Industry Guide to Blockchain</title>

      <guid>/post/2017-08-11-music-industry-guide-to-blockchain/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of discussion in the music industry right now around transparency and rights management. This is in tandem with a discussion on how this would be implemented, and at the moment that discussion is being led by blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is a relatively new technology, there’s not many who understand the technology and why it would be suggested as a solution for many of the music industry’s rights data challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Delaware House Passes Historic Blockchain Regulation The state of Delaware has passed amendments to state law that make explicit the right to trade stocks on a blockchain, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Crammed in at the last minute before the state House went into recess, the measures were part of a broader series of amendments that legally recognized any number of records being stored on a blockchain.

      <description>Streaming generates vast amounts of royalty data, and not all collecting societies are coping The growth of streaming has meant a vast increase in the amount of data being supplied to collecting societies in order to calculate the royalty payments due to songwriters and music publishers. Some are processing this data better than others, but issues with conflicting information in some society databases only makes things more difficult. Read more</description>

      <description>Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal Paying $1.6 Million a DAY In Major Label Guarantees
On-demand streaming services Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer, Rhapsody, and others collectively paid nearly $1.6 million in guaranteed payments a day to just three major recording labels last quarter. Total ‘minimum guarantees’ topped $144 million over the 91 day period, a figure that likely doesn’t include preferred advertising inventory and other juicy perks. That is on top of royalties for actual plays, which more than quintupled that figure.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As awareness moves beyond BitCoin and cryptocurrencies to distributed ledgers, blockchain is fast-becoming the dominant (theoretical) solution to challenges facing many industries. No more so than the music industry—an industry plagued with inefficient and outdated data practices that interferes with the creation and maintenance of reliable data records, resulting in unpaid royalty revenue to artists, publishers and labels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The US Music Industry Crossed A Threshold In 2016
Nielsen recently released its Year-End Music Report for 2016 and it details a pattern of music consumption in the United States that has never been seen before. Album sales in every format save one are down from 2015. Downloads of digital songs are down. And yet, overall music consumption was up 3%. The reason? On-demand streaming took over the music business. Read more</description>

      <description>Distributed Ledgers: Shared control, not shared data
