      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At DeFi Summit London, Paperchain worked with Centrifuge and the Maker Foundation (“Maker”) to advance $60,000 USD in Spotify revenue to a Paperchain record label customer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While media consumption has shifted to streaming and on demand models, the revenue and payments process hasn’t changed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue from a Spotify stream can take 3 months to reach a record label; 6 months to reach an artist. $100 billion USD sits trapped in 90 day accounts receivables across the wider digital media industry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The advance was issued live on stage using Centrifuge’s Tinlake finance application, and was originated in less than 30 minutes at a transaction cost of less than $3 USD;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has the potential to disrupt traditional financing and secured lending products through programmatic, data-driven asset creation, and low origination costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about something Tony Sheng wrote recently on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tonysheng.com/red-ocean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;smart contract protocols and red ocean&lt;/a&gt; theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the drive in speculative markets around cryptocurrencies, we saw an ever growing list of projects become funded, make promises, and for the large part continue to remain in incubation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing the Protocol Canvas — Designing Better Decentralized Protocols</title>
      <link>/post/2018-08-24-introducing-protocol-canvas-designing-better-decentralized-protocols/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Protocol Canvas is a means of mapping primitives between actors within a decentralized protocol. Derived from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Business Model Canvas&lt;/a&gt;, the Protocol Canvas is designed for decentralized systems and is a fully &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Paperchain/protocol-canvas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt; effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of creating the Protocol Canvas is to help individuals and organizations capture their protocol design in a standardized way and to contribute towards the newly-realized discipline of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tokenegineering.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Token Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
