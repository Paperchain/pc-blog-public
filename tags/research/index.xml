      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the publication Music Business Worldwide(MBW) published a story about Spotify denying that they are play-listing fake artists. There was some harsh criticism and claims that Spotify was creating its own recordings and putting them on their playlists. What struck me the most about this story was that the statement about there being a large amount of music on Spotify that was created by fake artists and that the “artist name” under which these tracks are listed cannot actually be identified. A list of 50 artists were published on MBW.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
